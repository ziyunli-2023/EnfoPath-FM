# EnfoPath: Energy-Informed Analysis of Generative Trajectories in Flow Matching

This repository contains the code and supplementary materials for the paper **"EnfoPath: Energy-Informed Analysis of Generative Trajectories in Flow Matching"** presented at the EurIPS 2025.

## Overview

We introduce **kinetic path energy (KPE)**, a physics-inspired diagnostic that quantifies the kinetic effort along generation trajectories in flow-based models. Our experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-256 reveal that:

- Higher KPE predicts stronger semantic quality
- Higher KPE inversely correlates with data density
